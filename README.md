# Adaptive Multi-Layer Perceptron fron Scratch

See `Custom-Multilayer-Perceptron.ipynb` for 2-Layer and adaptive implementation of the multilayer perceptron class that outperforms `Scikit-Learn`'s `MLPClassifier` implementation in runtime and accuracy on the US Census Demographic dataset, which can be found on Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data/data">here</a>.
